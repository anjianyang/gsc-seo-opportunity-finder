No Google API, login, database, payment, or AI is required in the current MVP.

## Current MVP Limitations

- No Google Search Console API
- No user accounts
- No database
- No payment flow
- No AI-generated recommendations
- Data is stored only in the current browser session

## Sample Dataset Formats

The `public/samples/` folder includes upload test files for CSV, TSV, tab-delimited TXT, XLSX, and XLS workflows:

- `gsc-high-impression-low-ctr.csv`
- `gsc-keyword-cluster.tsv`
- `gsc-near-page-one.txt`
- `gsc-good-performance.xlsx`
- `gsc-real-world-sample.xls`

## Negative Test Cases

The `public/samples/errors/` folder includes intentionally invalid upload files for validation testing:

- `gsc-missing-required-fields.csv`: missing the `query` column; should show `Required GSC fields missing`.
- `gsc-empty-file.csv`: blank CSV content; should show `Empty file`.
- `gsc-invalid-numeric-values.csv`: invalid `clicks`, `impressions`, `ctr`, and `position` values; should trigger row rejection or validation warnings.
- `gsc-invalid-numeric-values.xls`: legacy Excel file with invalid `clicks`, `impressions`, `ctr`, and `position` values; should show `Invalid numeric values detected`.
- `gsc-unsupported-format.json`: unsupported JSON upload; should show `Unsupported file type`.
- `gsc-no-worksheet-data.xlsx`: first worksheet has no rows; should show `No worksheet data found`.
